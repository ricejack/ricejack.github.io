        <p>Hello, my name is Jack Rice. I'm a senior at the University of Colorado at 
        Boulder graduating in December 2021 with a major in Information Science and a 
        minor in Business with an emphasis on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Using 
        information science, I am able to draw conclusions about certain data using technical 
        analytics such as Python and SQL and then connect these conclusions to the bigger 
        picture or problem at hand. In other words, I am able to analyze technical questions 
        then combine multiple disciplines to come up with solutions that apply to different 
        facets of the company. I am knowledgeable about financial markets, investing, blockchain, 
        and programming (specifically in Python) to name a few things. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy skiing, biking, and golfing. Over the summers, you can find me at 
        the nearest golf course hitting the ball into a pond.
