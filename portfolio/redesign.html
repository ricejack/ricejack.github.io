    <h1>Redesign of Portfolio</h1>
    <a href="jackrice.html">Home page</a>
    <p>On the home page I changed several things to utilize bootstrap. The first thing I changed was the navbar to use the bootstrap navbar, include a logo, make navbar dark, and other small navbar bootstrap implementations. I also changed the background image and textbox so that they used bootstrap and the site would look good on any browser, even mobile.</p>
    <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>
    <p>For the page that shows my portfolio, the current grid implementation already works pretty well but at some point I may change this to use the bootstrap grid. The biggest thing changed on this page was the navbar. I added a lot of bootstrap features to the navbar to make it look really nice (such as hovering over each thing and an "active page" color).</p>
    <a href="about.html">About</a>
    <p>I changed a lot with the about section despite it looking largely the same. I used bootstrap's grid feature which allowed me to add columns and rows and make the entire page pliable depending on the page size. As with the other two, it has the same implementation with the navbar.</p>
    <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
    <p>The contact page also used a grid to organize the content. Bootstrap classes like justify-content-center, col-auto, row-cols, and others were used to achieve a nice balanced contact page that can be manipulated with page size. Throughout all of these pages, I also updated many css elements to work well alongside bootstrap (for example using X number of px when setting margins or padding can mess with the fluid resizing of many bootstrap features.). </p>
