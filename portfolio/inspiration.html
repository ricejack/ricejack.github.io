    <h1>Inspiration of Portfolio</h1>
    <a href="https://harrisonjansma.com/archive">Harrison Jansma</a>
    <p>I really liked how Harrison used the navigation bar, likely with bootstrap, to make it easier to get around his website no matter the size of your browser.</p>
    <a href="https://tdhopper.com/">Tim Hopper</a>
    <p>On Tim's website, I thought I drew inspiration for mine with the use of the grid format in the articles section on the homepage. I liked how things were layed out nicely in a gridlike pattern with the images relating to each article.</p>
    <a href="https://binnie869.github.io/">Anubhav Gupta</a>
    <p>Anubhav used small icons in his contact section to link to different websites such as github, linkedin, email, etc. which I thought was very clean and a nice visual implenation. I used the same on my contact page.</p>
