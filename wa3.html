  Weekly Assignment #2

<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<div class="indent">
  <p>The events that took place over the past couple of weeks have been 
unprecedented in the capitalist world. While a short squeeze has been 
a well known concept for quite some time, the scale and who was 
behind the event is quite unusual. Typically large institutions are 
responsible for short squeeze scenarios but this time it was the 
little guys, and for many, it was payback against hedge funds 
for the 2008 housing market crash. This situation has huge 
implications for many people, no matter how wealthy or how little 
they even know about everything going on with <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/real-time">GME</a>. Researchers, 
politicians, the rich, the poor, and anyone in between can and likely 
will feel the fallout of this, whether its good or bad.

<h3>
    History of Purchasing Stock
</h3>
<div class="indent">
  <p>As an information scientist and from a data driven perspective, we can analyze what consequences this has for the United States 
and potentially the world. For much of capitalist history, buying and selling stocks, options, etc have been possible. In fact, 
purchasing shares dates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock#History">all the way back to the Roman Republic</a> which existed until 27 BC. Today, there are many differences from 
those early examples of stock, with the most recent being the access barrier breaking down. Companies like Robinhood along with the 
help of the internet has allowed anyone to trade, even complicated trading like options or on margin. The internet has also allowed for 
everyday people to discuss their trades, as those on Wall Street have done for decades.</p>
</div>
<h3>
    Social Media Implications
</h3>
<div class="indent">
  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html">Social media has been the main catalyst of the GME situation</a>. Websites such as Reddit and Discord have introduced a large discussion 
based avenue for anyone to share everything. In fact, there are Discord groups that are specifically designed for trading stocks, options, 
etc with some of the creators charging subscription fees to see the financial advice of others. It would not be a surprise if companies such 
as Discord or Reddit choose to limit these types of groups activity (WallStreetBets was banned on Discord following the situation but 
stated it was due to lack of moderation and hate speech). Unfortunately, this then goes into the political dillema that has everyone 
divided. </p>
</div>
<h3>
    Political Fallout
</h3>
<div class="indent">
  <p>Most politicians, the people who decide our country's future, are older than 40 years old. These individuals grew up and became adults 
during a time of no social media, little internet, and for them, in order to place a trade on the stock market, you called someone. 
It was a process to buy stock not too many years ago. Now, these lawmakers are required to have discussions around a concept that is 
brand new. Is 'mass manipulation' of the stock market technically illegal? Sort of. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/will-the-sec-sue-gamestop-traders-183845241.html">The laws are muddy with loopholes abound</a> meaning 
its technically allowed. The elitest and wealthy on Wall Street capitalize on this all the time, pumping so much into the market at a time 
that is heavily influences stock prices and in turn, the economy. There are issues with what WallStreetBets did that could lead to new laws 
and policies. While it may not be illegal, the consequences of 'going to war' against hedge funds who practically control the market could 
lead to recession level dips in other stocks if they have to cover their losses which would obviously affect the very people who attacked them.</p>
</div>
<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<div class="indent">
  <p>Nobody knows what sort of legislation or changes, if any, will come from this situation. It is a part of our capitalist society that has 
never needed to be addressed so everyone is in uncharted waters. What we do know, based on history, typically the wealthy and powerful have 
won battles like this. There is a large push from much of the nation currently that is against Wall Street and through the use of 
technology, voices are being heard which will weigh heavily on lawmakers. All we can do is kick back, eat some popcorn, watch GME moon or 
burn, and see history unfold.</p>
