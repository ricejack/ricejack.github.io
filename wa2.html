<p>
The events that took place over the past couple of weeks have been 
unprecedented in the capitalist world. While a short squeeze has been 
a well known concept for quite some time, the scale and who was 
behind the event is quite unusual. Typically large institutions are 
responsible for short squeeze scenarios but this time it was the 
little guys, and for many, it was payback against hedge funds 
for the 2008 housing market crash. This situation has huge 
implications for many people, no matter how wealthy or how little 
they even know about everything going on with GME. Researchers, 
politicians, the rich, the poor, and anyone in between can and likely 
will feel the fallout of this, whether its good or bad.
